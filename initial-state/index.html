			<p>The view below will render its initial state immediately.
				However, it needs to receive some data before it can render complete,
				and so will start out in an initializing state.  After the controller
				loads the data, it tell the view to render the data as content, at
				which point the view will switch from its initializing state to its
				"standard" or "idle" state, by removing its initializing class.</p>
